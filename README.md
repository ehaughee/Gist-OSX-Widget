# Gist OS X Widget (or Gist Paster) Alpha v0.2
This is an OS X widget that will take the contents of your clipboard, create a gist, and then place the relevant gist url in your clipboard.

## New to v0.2
* Ability to authenticate for gists so they are created under your account
 * The UI for this needs a lot of work
* Ability to select from Ruby, Python, PHP, HTML syntaxes
 * Super easy to add more languages, just haven't yet.
