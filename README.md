## Usage
* Copy some text
* On the widget (in your dashboard) click Create Gist
* You should see some status messages that end with "Link in clipboard"
* Paste the link

## Todo
* Syntax selection
* Authorization option (gists are currently created as Anonymous)
  * Currently the back has UI elements but they are not wired up
* Maybe add the option to set a filename and description, but probably not
